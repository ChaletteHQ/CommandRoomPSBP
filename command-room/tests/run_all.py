Command Room — full test battery runner (auto-discovering, tiered).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The plugin ships ~40+ test files under tests/. The old `run-command-room-tests`
skill hardcoded a list of FIVE of them and silently went stale at v2.14.x — new
test files (cru_match, backfill, event-contract, widget-transport, …) were never
run by the "run plugin tests" path. A hardcoded list is a staleness bug waiting
to happen.

This runner DISCOVERS every `run_*.py` / `test_*.py` in tests/ at call time, so a
new test file is picked up the moment it lands — no list to maintain. It groups
them into tiers, runs cheapest-and-most-structural first (fail fast), and prints
one consolidated pass/fail table.

TIERS (run in this order; --tier <name> runs just one)
  guard    structural / write-time invariants — privacy, jargon, retired skills,
           leak scan, entity-resolve enforcement, and the event-contract guard.
           These encode "this class of bug must never ship" and are the cheapest
           signal, so they run first.
  unit     pure-python unit suites — renderer, helpers, cru_match, backfill,
           writers, detectors, schedule config, etc. The bulk of the battery.
  runtime  code-path simulation against synthetic data (runtime_exercise_*,
           spec-example render). Catches the bug class that static unit tests
           structurally cannot (per feedback_static_analysis_vs_runtime_exercise).

Each test file is run as its own subprocess; a non-zero exit = fail (house
convention, see any run_*_test.py).

DEPENDENCIES: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (repo root) before running.
The battery is stdlib-only EXCEPT for pyyaml, tzdata and jsonschema. That claim
used to read "stdlib only, no external deps", which was untrue and cost real
debugging time: two suites responded to a missing dependency by printing SKIP
and exiting 0, so the battery reported green while those checks silently did not
run. Both now fail loudly. If you add a suite with a third-party import, declare
it in requirements.txt and make the absence loud.

USAGE
  python tests/run_all.py                 # full battery, all tiers
  python tests/run_all.py --tier guard    # just the structural guards
  python tests/run_all.py --tier unit
  python tests/run_all.py --tier runtime
  python tests/run_all.py --quiet         # summary only, no per-test lines

Exit code is non-zero if ANY test fails — safe to wire into a ship gate.
