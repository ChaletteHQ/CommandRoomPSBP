"""The run-log audit - what a fire actually did, read off its own run log
(IDENT1 I-8; ruling R-RW2-2 NARROW, 2026-09-22).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Guard G69 polices the INSTRUCTION LAYER: the fenced python
blocks the skills carry, against the census allowance. It never sees a run
log. The re-walk's rule "zero `python3 -c` in the run log" was a scorekeeper's
rule with no tool behind it, and the 2026-09-22 fire's log carried four such
bodies - every one a JSON parse over the run's own `/tmp` files - beside two
heredocs that opened `entities.json` and `events.jsonl` directly. M ruled the
rule NARROW: an improvised body that opens, reads or writes a WORKSPACE file
fails the fire; a body over the run's own scratch is a note, never a fail.
The structural fence is the write door (R-RW2-3), not a grep - this audit is
the scorekeeper's instrument, and it says which of the two a body is.

WHAT IT READS. The expanded run log, as text: the commands the chat ran and
the lines it posted. It answers ONE dict:

  bodies        every improvised python body - `python3 -c`, a `python3 -`
                heredoc, or a `python3 <file>` outside the plugin's own
                scripts - with its line, its kind, its class (`workspace` when
                it names the customer's workspace, `scratch` otherwise) and
                the workspace tokens it names;
  narration     every line the fire-narration family reds (I-4);
  asks          every line the unattended-ask family reds (I-16), when the
                family is present;
  docs          every line the unattended-doc family reds (DOCS1 D-3): a
                fire naming or offering a Claude Doc, a page or a deck it
                made outside the folder - the republished page line is
                exempt by identity;
  widget_line   the line of the first widget call (`show_widget`), or None;
  after_widget  every prose line posted after it;
  surface_line  on a fire with NO widget: the line of the LAST saved-at
                sentence (`Saved to `...``, "saved at `...`", or the "under
                ... in your Command Room folder" form), or None;
  after_surface every prose line after it - the saved-at line is the last
                thing a no-widget fire says (R-RW3-4). On a SILENT fire
                (`silent=True`, CLI `--silent`) the contract is silence:
                EVERY prose line is listed except the maintenance close
                constant (`maintenance_dispatcher.SILENT_CLOSE_LINE`, read by
                import; "" when the tree does not carry it);
  reached       T2 FIRE1 MUST 2 (FIX-8, F-OFF-6): did the run reach its
                workspace? `{"reached", "reason", "why", "request_line",
                "ok_line", "door_lines"}` - NOT reached when the run made
                a folder request and no envelope answered `"ok": true` with
                `"folder_attached": true` after it, or carries no door line
                at all, or was refused for want of the folder and never
                answered ok after (`reached_workspace`). A silent run that
                did not reach it is a FAIL named
                `no_workspace_reached`: on the second computer two
                maintenance fires found no folder, asked for none, closed
                `Done.`, and this audit passed them;
  verdict       {"g69": FAIL|NOTE|PASS, "narration": FAIL|PASS,
                 "after_widget": FAIL|PASS, "after_surface": FAIL|PASS,
                 "asks": FAIL|PASS, "docs": FAIL|PASS,
                 "reached": FAIL|PASS (silent) or NOTE|PASS}.

THE PRODUCT'S OWN CLOSING LINES are never a finding (T2 FIRE1 MUST 2): the
inbox driver's draft line (`inbox_helpers.DRAFT_HINT_LINE`) is exempt from
the ask family by identity, and on a silent run the maintenance close
(`SILENT_CLOSE_LINE`) and a saved-at line are allowed ONLY after the run
reached its workspace; the one stop sentence a fire that reached nothing
says (`maintenance_dispatcher.no_workspace_line()`) is allowed as prose, and
the run still FAILs `reached`.

The door's own calls (`workspace_access.py <verb>`) and the plugin's own
scripts are the product, not an improvisation, and are never listed. The
product's own discover heredoc (`workspace_access.DISCOVER_BLOCK`, pasted into
the device shell exactly as the bootloader says) is listed with class `door`
and never counts toward G69 (R-RW3-5 (i); the 2026-09-23 fire's one G69 hit
was that block). A heredoc whose end tag never appears stops at the next
prompt or tool line instead of eating the rest of the log. A `python3 -c`
whose quoted body runs over several lines is read to its closing quote and
classed by the WHOLE body (R-RW3-5 (ii); the same fire's four scratch bodies
opened on the line after the opener and were missed).

3.10-safe, stdlib only - it runs wherever the log is.
