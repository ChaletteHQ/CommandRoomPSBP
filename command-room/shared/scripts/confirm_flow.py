confirm_flow.py — THE unconfirmed-commitment confirm-flow selectors
(v4.6.1 W4b; FINDINGS F-13 P2b / F-56 — the persisting owner
misattributions this flow exists to catch).

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
===================
Before W4b, needs-confirm items sat age-buried in the full triage pool (a
fresh ambiguous capture was 17 pages deep behind 50-day-old items), and
person_proposals appeared ONCE in whatever widget captured them — dismiss
that chat and the proposal was stranded pending_review forever.

The principle: **unconfirmed items don't age into the pool — they escalate
to confirmation.**

  select_confirm_items(...)          the daily "Needs a quick confirm" set:
                                     every capture younger than the 7-day
                                     escalation pin that is pending_review,
                                     unowned, or carries a C4
                                     suspected_duplicate_of flag (v4.6.1 S3:
                                     widened from 24h — items aged 1-7 days
                                     used to fall in a hole between the
                                     daily section and the pin)
  load_open_person_proposals(...)    unadjudicated person_proposal /
                                     person_update_proposal events — these
                                     re-surface EVERY day until adjudicated
                                     (the stranding fix), no age window
  select_promotion_proposals(...)    kind=task items that gained a
                                     resolvable counterparty → "Make it a
                                     commitment?" proposals (4.6 fold-in;

                                     (never age-buried); 30d+ → weekly
                                     cleanup proposes Drop (manual click)
  confirm_pointer_line(n)            the morning brief's ONE pointer line —
                                     None when the confirm set is empty
                                     (the line renders only when non-empty)
  build_person_proposal_resolved_event(...)
                                     the proposal tombstone (Add person /
                                     Same as / Not relevant all write it, so
                                     adjudicated proposals stop re-surfacing)

GUARDRAILS (restated wherever these rows render)
================================================
- Unconfirmed items NEVER enter chase — no auto-email on a guessed owner.
  Selection here changes SURFACING only; chase eligibility is enforced in
  cru_match / the orchestrator filters.
- Unconfirmed items count ONLY in the headline "unconfirmed" bucket
  (commitment_state.count_commitments — R4's one bucket export); nothing
  here re-derives counts.
- Proposals re-surface daily until adjudicated. Adjudication is an event
  (owner confirm / reassign / close / promote / person_proposal_resolved),
  never a rendering side effect.

Pure functions over caller-supplied data wherever possible; the only file
I/O is the explicitly-named load_open_person_proposals.
