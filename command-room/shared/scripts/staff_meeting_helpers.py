"""The staff meeting and the health check — named entry points, for the
workspace access layer.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (ORCH2, Night M3). `system-health/SKILL.md` and
`orchestrator-staff-meeting.md` carried five python blocks that opened the
customer's workspace in-process: the health verdict, the self-report's
substrate lines, the change feed and queue read, the staff meeting's window
read, and its lateness check. On a merged seat those blocks ran in a
container with no workspace. Each is now ONE `plan run_helper` line naming a
function here.

THE RULE EVERY FUNCTION HERE OBEYS (workspace_access review B-1, R-M2-6): it
reads or computes and writes nothing. Three places where the old block
called a function that CAN write are read here through the pure half the
function itself delegates to, never through a copy of its logic:

  * `task_alarm.dark_surfaces(..., record=False)` IS
    `_strip_private(classify_dark_surfaces(...))` — its own docstring says the
    two are identical when `record` is False — and the helper calls exactly
    that, so the render-once ledger writer is not reachable from this door.
  * `seq_health.detect_and_mark(ws)` with no `apply` IS `_detect(ws)` behind
    its phantom-path refusal; `detect_and_mark_gaps(ws)` IS `_detect_gaps(ws)`
    behind the same. The marker-writing branch is the weekly cleanup's.
  * `substrate_health.substrate_alarm_lines` SWEEPS resolved alerts on its
    way through (a file removal), so it is not a read and is not here: the
    health check asks it through the WRITE door (`plan run_writer`), and on a
    seat whose writer cannot be named the alarm lines are the one part of the
    self-report that does not render.

The staff meeting's widget and its receipt are the one-command driver, run
through the WRITE door since ORCH2 fix pass 1 (`run_staff_meeting_surface`,
below — the CLI leg `surface_drivers.py staff-meeting` ran in the cloud
session's own shell and drew an EMPTY card there, a false all-clear). Its
unnamed-speaker count line is a read here (`unnamed_speakers`). The one
receipt this surface writes in prose — the degrade branch, and the health
check's empty-queue line — is composed here (`plan_staff_receipt`).

3.10-safe: this module ships in the runtime manifest.
