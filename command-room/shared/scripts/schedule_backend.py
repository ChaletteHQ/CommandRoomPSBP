"""Schedule backend seam — planner and normaliser, never a caller (BOOT3).

Command Room used to talk to ONE scheduler: the old desktop app's scheduled-task
tools, five-field cron in MACHINE-local time, one registry per box. The merged
Claude app has a different one: `mcp__claude-code-remote__*` triggers, cron in
UTC with an hourly minimum, one registry per ACCOUNT, and a fire that runs in a
fresh cloud session. Un-merged seats still run the old one. This module is the
seam between the two. The old scheduler's tool ids are NEVER spelled here —
`legacy_tools.LEGACY_TOOL_MAP` is their one home and this module inverts it
(guard G67).

Two rules shape everything here:

1. **Nothing in this file calls a tool.** Python cannot invoke an MCP tool, and
   the DOORS1 fence (`tests/run_schedview1_test.py`, `tests/run_doors1_test.py`)
   makes that explicit: nothing under `shared/scripts/` may reach a live
   scheduled task. So the module produces `CallPlan` objects that a SKILL
   executes, and `normalize`s raw readback into the task-record dict every
   reader already consumes. The MERGED app's tool names appear here as STRING
   CONSTANTS, which is what GUARD1's widened token list allows; the OLD app's
   are not spelled here at all — every one of them is derived from
   `legacy_tools.LEGACY_TOOL_MAP`, so there is exactly one home for them.
2. **Dual backend** (gap analysis §0.23). The backend is chosen from the tool
   list the model can actually see, never from an environment marker — the same
   lesson `task_watchdog.detect_registry_vantage` already teaches. Where the
   legacy shape is visible, behaviour is byte-for-byte today's.

Registration is GATED OFF in the shipped config (`shared/config/schedule_backend.json`,
gap analysis §0.9): nothing registers on any seat until the v3 bootloader and the
workspace access layer ship on the same cut. While the gate is blocked, planning a
CREATE or a cron CHANGE returns a `Refusal` carrying one customer sentence; listing,
verifying, firing an existing trigger and deleting Command Room's own probes stay
live.

3.10-safe by contract: this module may be read inside the sandbox VM (Python
3.10.12), so no `datetime.UTC`, no `StrEnum`, no `tomllib`, no `typing.Self`.

# The `schedule-realign` quiet job (gap analysis §5.2 option 2; spec §6 item 5)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A cron registered in UTC is a FIXED instant of the day. The customer's 7 AM is
# not: it moves by an hour twice a year. Converting once at registration means
# the morning brief quietly fires at 6 AM all winter, which is the posture the
# product has today and the reason this job exists.
#
# The job compares the offset stored on each trigger with the offset the zone is
# actually on, and when they differ it plans ONE update per Command Room trigger
# that re-projects the same local time onto the new UTC hour. The local cron does
# not change — the customer did not move anything — so the job writes
# `schedule_refreshed(field="cron_utc")` and NEVER `schedule_config_changed`.
# `cron_utc` is deliberately not one of `schedule_refresh.SEMANTIC_FIELDS`, so
# the morning brief never announces a no-op the customer did not ask about.
#
# The job PLANS. The maintenance fire executes the plans, the same way every
# other plan in this module is executed by the surface that owns the call.
#
# Fallback, documented and not built: if a cron-only update on a device-bound
# trigger turns out to need a click on the customer's computer, the answer is a
# shadow slot — register both candidate UTC hours and have the bootloader exit
# when the workspace wall clock is not the slot. It costs one extra fire a day
# per chat and needs the lateness math to learn the shadow slot, which is why it
# is the fallback rather than the plan.

    Precedence (the first that holds wins):
      1. `stubs_not_loaded` — the list carries a deferred-stub entry, OR no
         scheduler is on it while `env_mode` is a seat that serves deferred
         stubs and the discovery step has not run (`signals["discovery_ran"]`)
         — and the step has NOT already reloaded once (`signals["reloaded"]`):
         after the one reload the answer is final, so a name still waiting
         falls through to the causes below rather than promising another load;
      2. `not_initialized` — the scheduler's own error says it is not
         initialized;
      3. `cloud_session_no_folder` — a merged cloud session with no workspace
         folder attached (`signals["folder_attached"] is False`);
      4. `feature_off` — the error says the feature is disabled;
      5. `none_visible` — `NO_SCHEDULER_LINE`, unchanged.
    Pure: reads its arguments, calls nothing, writes nothing.

    """The ONE line a scheduling skill opens with — as a list of 0 or 1 lines.

    The rendered site of the discovery step (review M-2): every carrier pastes
    ONE call to this helper and says what it returns, verbatim. Three answers:

      * the guard answered `available: True` → the declaration of where the
        chats run (`backend_declaration_line` over what `select_backend` finds
        on the LOADED names) — or, when the scheduler's own call failed and
        `error_text` carries its words, the cause line for that error instead;
      * the guard answered `available: False` because there is NO scheduler
        (`scheduler_unavailable`) → the cause line (`no_scheduler_cause`), which
        replaces the no-scheduler sentence;
      * anything else — the guard refused a scheduler it DID find
        (`registration_blocked`, M's seat), or no guard answer at all → `[]`.
        The guard's own refusal sentence stands alone there (H-1; COPY1: "the
        refusal sentence is the only thing this skill may say on that seat").

    `tools` is step 2's list: the loaded names, plus any scheduler name still
    waiting as `{"name": <id>, "deferred": True}` — a waiting name is never a
    scheduler (R-SD-4) and only ever feeds the "not loaded" cause.
    `discovery_ran` is True by construction: the call form lives inside the
    step, after its load. `reloaded` is True on the step's one reload, after
    which the answer is final. An empty string is never emitted.
    Pure: reads its arguments, calls nothing, writes nothing.
