name: intro-broker
surfaces: both
description: "Draft introductions between two people you know, and check whether the ones you made landed. Fires on: 'check my intros', 'did my intros land', 'intro follow-ups' (the due 30-day checks), plus 'intro [name] to [name]', 'introduce [name] and [name]', 'draft an intro between [A] and [B]', 'connect [name] with [name]', 'make the intro'. Voice-calibrated to your past intros, tuned to both sides' context, and logged into the relationship graph. Checks both sides' history, drafts the double-opt-in ask where appropriate, and always lands as a draft for your review — never sends on its own. Does NOT fire on 'draft an email to [name]' (email-writer — single-recipient drafting), 'who do I know at [company]' (people-crm — the search that often precedes an intro), or 'who should I reach out to' (relationship-moves)."
---

## Entity-resolve + canonical-helper enforcement (mandatory, v3.13.8+)

Before resolving the two people in the intro request, you MUST call `shared/scripts/entity_resolve.py::resolve_all(workspace_root, query)` for EACH name. Multi-candidate results MUST surface a disambiguation widget — do NOT silently pick the first match. Only after `resolve_all` returns no candidates for a name may you fall back to grep, and that fallback MUST be flagged to the user. See `shared/ENTITY_RESOLVE_PROTOCOL.md` for the full contract.

## Skill Boundary (v2.1)

- **Use intro-broker for:** drafting an introduction email between two people you know. Two-sided draft work with relationship-graph writes.
- **Use `email-writer` for:** single-recipient email drafts (no intro framing).
- **Use `people-crm` for:** looking up either person before deciding to intro.

## Writer Contract (v3.8.0+ — substrate-native)

Before writing to any workspace file, read `shared/WORKSPACE_API.md`.

**Appends to:**
- `_hq/data/events.jsonl` — event type `intro_made` with TOP-LEVEL `person_ids: [person_a_id, person_b_id]` (canonical Event shape per events.schema.json) plus `data: {person_a_id, person_b_id, draft_style, why_intro_summary, email_drafted_event_seq, scheduled_followup_check_ts}`. The top-level `person_ids` array is what apply-choices reads when the Pulse intro-followup-check resolves to `landed` / `didnt land`; the `data.person_a_id` / `data.person_b_id` scalars are preserved for downstream skills that want explicit A/B roles. v3.13.6+ — pre-v3.13.6 only the scalars were written; the missing top-level array silently severed the relationship-graph closure (apply-choices Step 3c read `parent["person_ids"]` and got `None`).
- `_hq/data/events.jsonl` — event type `intro_followup_check` scheduled 30 days out (a future-dated event this skill's `check my intros` mode reads back). Carries `{intro_event_seq, scheduled_for, check_question: "did either reply / did the meeting happen"}`. The check event itself does NOT carry person_ids — they live on the parent `intro_made` event (apply-choices Step 3c fetches them via the `intro_event_seq` reference).
- `_hq/data/entities.json` — both people's records get a `connections[]` entry pointing at the other's `person_id`, with `connection_source: "intro_made"`, `connection_event_seq`, `connected_ts`. Both records bump `last_touched_at`.

**Append through the locked writer (SPEC GATE1 / A1).** Both events.jsonl appends above MUST go through `atomic_append_jsonl` (NOT a hand-rolled `next_seq`+`open('a')` or a raw `>>`) — the helper reserves the seq and writes inside the cross-process writer lock so a concurrent append can't lose an event or duplicate a seq. Omit `seq`/`ts` (auto-stamped); pass `holder="intro-broker"`. See `shared/WORKSPACE_API.md` → Append Protocol §3.

**Reads from:** All `events.jsonl` reads below come from ONE org-scoped load — **read via the org-scoped reader, never a raw load** (PGUARD2 — the intro email reaches two external people): `from events_io import load_events_org_scoped; org_events, skipped = load_events_org_scoped(workspace_root)`, then filter by `type` at the call site. The reader applies the account-scope mask and drops personal-lane rows by design, so masked-account intros and interactions never enter the depth read or the voice corpus.
- `_hq/data/entities.json` — both people's full records: org, role, relationship strength tier, prior interactions, decision context where they appear.
- `_hq/data/events.jsonl` — `type == "interaction"` events with each person (from the org-scoped load) to compute relationship depth and recent context.
- `_hq/data/events.jsonl` — `type == "intro_made"` events you've sent before (from the org-scoped load), used as voice samples for the draft style. The user's past intros are the canonical training corpus for "how you actually write intros" — better than the generic Voice Block.
- `_hq/data/events.jsonl` — `type == "decision"` events that mention either person or their org in `data.context` (from the org-scoped load) — surfaces "your stated positions" about either side that should inform the framing.

**Conflict boundary:** sole writer of `intro_made` and `intro_followup_check` events. People-crm owns entities.json person records; this skill writes ONLY to the `connections[]` sub-array (namespaced) and `last_touched_at` field — no collision per the people-crm convention.

# intro-broker

**Correction in passing (shared contract — `shared/CORRECTION_IN_PASSING.md`).** Before answering any turn, pass the user's message to `correction_turn.handle_correction_turn(workspace_root, text, skill="intro-broker")`. When it returns a result, say its `receipt` in one clause inside your real answer and then answer the request — never instead of it, never as a question, never as a card. When it returns `None`, proceed exactly as you would have. The module applies the change, writes the correction to the store with `origin: asked`, and logs a `router_miss` when the complaint was about routing; you neither re-apply nor re-record any of that. When the turn is someone holding up a document and saying to make it like that, pass the document body as `document=<the text>` in the same call — that is the only path that banks a structural correction, and without it the shape they just showed you is lost.

**Learned constraints, read BEFORE composing (SPEC_SURFACES2 §1).** Once the recipient is resolved and before you write a single line, load what they have already corrected:

```python
from draft_constraints import load_draft_constraints, apply_draft_constraints
c = load_draft_constraints(workspace_root, "intro-broker",
                           recipient_id=<person id or None>,
                           domain=<the draft's domain or None>)
```

`c["lines"]` are CONSTRAINTS, not suggestions — obey each one. `c["override_block"]` is this skill's learned voice block and supersedes the `## Voice Block` below section by section. Anything the person has STATED in this request outranks all of it. When you have a draft, run it through `apply_draft_constraints(draft, c)` before you show it — that is what actually holds the learned paragraph ceiling and drops the phrases they keep taking out. Do not skip this because the corrections log looks short: a recipient who cut two drafts down is the whole reason it exists.


The introduction is one of the CEO's most-leveraged communication moves and also one of the easiest to do badly. A generic intro template ("X meet Y, you should know each other") is why people get bad intros. A good intro requires knowing both relationships well enough to frame the value prop tuned to each side — exactly what the Command Room substrate has.

## What It Does

For an intro request between Person A and Person B, this skill:

1. Loads both people's full context from people-crm + interaction events.
2. Identifies the "why this intro" angle by intersecting: A's needs/projects vs B's offerings/portfolio (or vice versa).
3. Drafts TWO emails — a double-opt-in version (recommended) and a direct-forward version (faster) — so the CEO picks the right intro shape.
4. Pre-drafts a companion note for the double-opt-in flow (sent after the first recipient says yes).
5. Logs the intro to the relationship graph so future `people-crm` queries surface "you connected them on [date]" automatically.
6. Schedules a 30-day follow-up check, answerable on demand — say `check my intros` (see "Checking intros" below).

## How to Use

```
"intro Bo to Rio"
"connect Bo and Rio"
"make an intro between Bo and Rio"
"introduce Bo to Rio"
"broker an intro between Bo and Rio"
"set up an intro: Bo ↔ Rio"
```

If only one name is given ("intro Bo to..." or "make an intro for Bo"), the skill asks who the other side should be.

If either name is ambiguous (multiple matches in entities.json), the skill asks which person.

## How It Works

### Phase 1 — Resolve both people

Resolve A and B via `aliases.json` + `entities.json` person records. If ambiguous, surface a disambiguation prompt. If either is not in entities.json, ask whether the user wants to add them via `people-crm` first.

### Phase 2 — Build "why this intro"

Intersect A's context with B's context:
- A's open projects / needs (from project tags + recent commitments + active deals)
- B's offerings (from B's role + org + portfolio if known)
- Any explicit signal in your interactions with either ("X mentioned looking for distribution help" / "Y's portfolio includes operator-led SaaS")

Compose a 1-2 sentence "why this intro makes sense" framing. This is the differentiator from a generic intro template.

### Phase 3 — Voice-calibrate from past intros

Read `_hq/data/events.jsonl` for prior `intro_made` events you've sent (up to last 20) — from the Reads section's org-scoped load (`load_events_org_scoped`), never a raw read; a masked account's intros stay out of the corpus. For each, read the linked `email_drafted` event's content (resolve the link within the same org-scoped rows). These become the voice corpus — your actual intro style, not a generic template. With few unmasked prior intros the corpus is thin — degrade to the generic Voice Block, exactly as a young workspace does.

Extract patterns: opener style, length, signoff, "vouching" language, whether you typically do double-opt-in vs direct-forward.

### Phase 4 — Draft both styles

**Draft 1 — Double-opt-in (recommended):**
- Email to A asking permission, vouching for B, explaining why
- Companion note pre-drafted to B (sent after A's yes)

**Draft 2 — Direct-forward:**
- Single email to A and B
- You frame both ends, then exit ("take it from here")

Voice-calibrated via past intros (Phase 3) + this skill's Voice Block fallback.

**Mechanical voice-tell gate (B2 — bash-gated, not prose).** After drafting each intro email (both styles, plus the double-opt-in companion note) and before surfacing them, run each body through the deterministic detector. It hard-fails on the exact banned phrases in `shared/VOICE_CALIBRATION.md`; structural tells warn:

**Customer voice-block override (B1):** before drafting, read `_hq/voice/voice-block-intro-broker.md` if it exists — it supersedes the skill's default register (the matching Voice Block in the shared calibration layer — `shared/VOICE_CALIBRATION.md` + the workspace's calibrated blocks; this file carries no `## Voice Block` section of its own) section-by-section (override sections replace same-named defaults; absent sections fall through). The universal banned-phrase list still applies except where the override's Taboos explicitly carve out an item. Staleness reads the override's `Last refreshed:` first.

```bash
# >>> CR ACCESS PREAMBLE v6 (CONTRACT Rule 22; shared/WORKSPACE_ACCESS.md) >>>
# The substrate is on the customer's machine; this process may not be. Every
# read, helper and write goes through workspace_access ON the host that holds
# the data. Never open, copy or tar a workspace file into this session, and
# never write one from here.
#  1 RESOLVE, once per call. The four lines below name the plugin root, the
#    environment, and -- on a seat whose files are local -- the workspace. On a
#    merged seat resolve instead with `workspace_access.py discover`, hand the
#    block it prints to the device shell, and keep its answer: WS, RT, BRAIN,
#    MODE; and DEVICE = the entry in get_device_info's connectedFolders whose
#    last path segment is WS's basename -- export CR_DEVICE_WORKSPACE="$DEVICE"
#    before the first plan, so a saved document can name the folder the
#    customer opens. A runtime that is absent, or a runtime_version that
#    differs, is a STOP: run the update-bridge install step. There is no
#    container fallback.
#  2 BRAIN. When BRAIN is not null, `plan read` it first -- one call.
#  3 HELPERS. One verb is one call (150 s budget). Render the command ONLY with
#    `workspace_access.py plan run_helper --json '{"name":"<module:function>",
#    "args":{...}}'` and paste what it prints, verbatim -- INCLUDING the
#    variables in front of python3, which carry the writer identity and the
#    run mode to the host that holds the data. The reply is one JSON
#    envelope; ok:false is a stop, never a hand retry.
#  4 WRITES. Only `plan write` and `plan append_jsonl` -- never an append
#    redirect, an in-place edit, a heredoc into the workspace, or a python body
#    that opens a substrate file.
#  5 LEGACY / LOCAL. When this seat's files are on this filesystem -- an older
#    sandbox seat, or a Code session on the customer's own machine -- the same
#    verbs run in this shell, and the four lines below resolve it for them.
#  6 THE SURFACE IS THE WHOLE ANSWER. A step that could not run gets ONE
#    sentence with no file, script, path, variable, shell text or mechanism
#    in it -- "One step could not run here; what is below is complete." or
#    "... is partial." Never narrate a workaround, never say what you tried.
#  7 STAGING. A file this chat needs for itself -- a widget copy, a scratch
#    render -- lives in this session's own scratch, never under the
#    workspace. Nothing under `_hq/` is created, copied or removed by a
#    redirect, `cp`, `tee` or `rm`: a file is written by `plan write` and
#    removed by `plan remove`, and a removal is reported in the envelope's
#    own words -- removed, moved aside, or still there -- never as done.
#  8 WRITERS. A document, a receipt, a close or a re-pin is written by
#    `plan run_writer` naming a writer on its list -- never by importing a
#    writer in a shell. The door forwards who you are; a writer with no
#    identity on this seat refuses in one sentence, and that sentence is the
#    whole answer.

On exit 1 (`FAIL`), rewrite the flagged lines and re-run until it exits 0 (`pass`/`warn`). Never surface a draft the detector still fails. A phrase the CEO's calibrated Voice Block (or a past-intro sample) demonstrably uses is exempt via `allow_phrases`; never improvise the override.

### Phase 5 — Render widget + capture choice

**v3.13.0+ — surface via the canonical chat action widget per `shared/EMAIL_DRAFT_PROTOCOL.md` (universal scope as of v3.13.0).** Both drafts go into a single widget as two items so the user picks one (or edits before sending). Data view shape:

```python
data_view = {
    "widget_mode": "all_batch_widget",
    "header": f"Intro: {person_a_name} ↔ {person_b_name}",
    "sub_header": "Two draft styles below — pick the one that fits, edit if needed, send.",
    "sections": [{
        "title": None,
        "count": None,
        "items": [
            {
                "n": 1,
                "icon": "🤝",
                "name": "Draft 1 — Double opt-in (recommended)",
                # metadata is LIST OF [key, value] PAIRS — required for the
                # data-shape validator to recognize this as email-shaped.
                "metadata": [
                    ["To", person_a_email],
                    ["Subject", draft_1_subject],
                ],
                "context_tag": "Asks the first side for permission before looping the other in",
                "body_lines": [f"> {line}" for line in draft_1_body.split(chr(10))],
                "actions": ["1 send", "1 draft", "1 snooze 3d"],
            },
            {
                "n": 2,
                "icon": "🤝",
                "name": "Draft 2 — Direct forward",
                "metadata": [
                    ["To", person_a_email],
                    ["Subject", draft_2_subject],
                ],
                "context_tag": "Faster — connects both sides in one note",
                "body_lines": [f"> {line}" for line in draft_2_body.split(chr(10))],
                "actions": ["2 send", "2 draft", "2 snooze 3d"],
            },
        ],
    }],
}
from widget_transport import render_and_persist
transport = render_and_persist(data_view=data_view, wrapper="fragment",
                               persist_dir="<WORKSPACE>/_hq/.system/widgets",
                               name_hint="intro-broker")
# Pass transport["html"] to mcp__visualize__show_widget as widget_code (persisted page bytes, verbatim) (EW2+T, F-15 —
# shared/CHAT_ACTION_WIDGET.md § Transport). Never hand-compose or post-process the HTML.
```

Per `EMAIL_DRAFT_PROTOCOL.md` §1, the user clicking `N send` triggers Gmail-send via the canonical dispatch order (Zapier-threaded → native threaded → standalone fallback). The double-opt-in companion note (Draft 1) ships separately on confirmation of A's yes; that second-stage workflow stays as documented in this skill — it's just the FIRST stage (which draft to send to A) that's now widget-driven instead of plain-text-driven.

### Phase 6 — Log to substrate

On send:
1. Chain to `email-writer` for the actual send (writes `email_drafted` + `email_sent`)
2. Append `intro_made` event linking both people + the `email_drafted_event_seq`
3. Update both people's `connections[]` in entities.json
4. Schedule `intro_followup_check` 30d out

### Phase 6.5 — Log the double-opt-in second stage (v3.19.x — FIX1 item 22)

When the double-opt-in path is used (Draft 1 = "ask the first side first"), the companion email that loops in the OTHER side ships AFTER A says yes — a second stage that, pre-FIX1, never reached the substrate. The 30-day `intro_followup_check` could therefore only see A's half and would mis-read a fully-completed intro as half-done. When that companion note is sent:

1. **Chain the actual send through `email-writer`** (writes `email_drafted` + `email_sent`) — never hand-send. Same canonical dispatch order as Phase 6.
2. On the companion note's `email_drafted` event, set `data.companion_to_intro_event_seq = <seq of the Phase 6 `intro_made` event>` so the two halves are explicitly linked.
3. `intro_followup_check` (30d) now reads BOTH halves: an intro counts as fully made only when the Phase 6 `intro_made` AND this companion `email_sent` both exist. If only A's half is present after 30 days, surface: *"You asked [A] about the intro to [B] but never looped [B] in — want me to finish it?"*

For the Direct-forward path (Draft 2), both sides are connected in one send, so there is no second stage — Phase 6 alone fully records it and `companion_to_intro_event_seq` is not used.

## Checking intros — the due 30-day follow-ups (SPEC LIFECYCLE1)

**Fires on:** `check my intros`, `did my intros land`, `intro follow-ups`.

(`how did that intro go` is deliberately NOT a trigger: it lands on workspace-manager's catch-all, and the trigger suite proved it. A phrase advertised here that routes somewhere else is worse than one that is not advertised at all.)

This skill writes `intro_followup_check` 30 days out; until LIFECYCLE1 the retired Pulse chat was the ONLY surface that ever read one back, so retiring that chat without this mode would have left every check sitting in the log unanswered forever. Same trade M ruled for the dormancy questions: the ask survives, it just waits to be asked for instead of arriving unbidden.

1. Read `events.jsonl`. Take every `intro_followup_check` whose `data.scheduled_for` is on or before today (workspace local time).
2. Drop any whose `data.intro_event_seq` already has a later `intro_landed` / `intro_didnt_land`, or a `chat_dismissal` referencing this check's seq — the CEO already answered.
3. Drop, and silently resolve with an `intro_landed`, any where BOTH recipients have an `interaction` event between them dated after the intro: they connected, and asking would be asking about something that visibly worked.
4. Render what remains, oldest `scheduled_for` first, at most 5 in one sitting. One row per check, both names in the title, the registered verbs `landed` / `didnt land` / `snooze 14d` / `skip` — the same verbs `apply-choices` has always dispatched for this family, taken from the taxonomy, never re-typed.
5. Nothing due → *"Nothing to check — no intros are past their 30-day mark."* Not an error, not an empty widget.

## Output Structure (widget)

**Output guard (PL.10):** no internal tokens, paths, event names, or version numbers in anything the CEO sees — vocabulary per `shared/VOICE_CALIBRATION.md` § Plain-language glossary.

- ❌ "Logged intro_made; connections graph updated; intro_followup_check scheduled 30d out"
- ✅ "Logged the intro — I'll check back in a month to see if it landed."

Intro: Bo Sample ↔ Rio Sample

Your read on each side:
  Bo:  Building founder-led distribution. Met 2026-03-12.
       Live thread about partnership structure.
  Rio: Northstar Partners — invests in operator-class SaaS.
       You've sent her 3 intros that closed; she trusts your picks.

Why this intro: Rio's portcos need exactly the distribution model
Bo's building. Specific, not generic.

——— Draft 1 — Double opt-in (recommended) ———

  To: bo@example.com
  Subject: Quick ask — intro to Rio Sample?

  Bo —

  Quick one: would you want an intro to Rio Sample at Northstar
  Partners? She invests in operator-class SaaS and her portcos need
  exactly the founder-led distribution you're building.

  I'd vouch for both ends. If you're game, I'll send a separate note
  to her first, then loop you in once she's a yes.

  Matthew

  (Companion note to Rio is pre-drafted and ready to send once Bo says yes.)

[Send Draft 1]  [Send Draft 2]  [Edit either]  [Cancel]
```

## DOES NOT

- Auto-send. All drafts go to Gmail Drafts via `email-writer`; user reviews and clicks Send.
- Create a person record. If A or B isn't in entities.json, the user must add them via `people-crm` first.
- Re-introduce two people already connected. If both already have each other in `connections[]`, surface "you already connected them on [date]" and ask whether to re-introduce.

## Narration leak scan (CUT-C item 8 — MANDATORY on every composed line)

Widget bodies are scanned inside `widget_transport.render_and_persist`; the PROSE this skill composes around them is not, unless this step runs. Before posting any sentence you composed — an ack, a header, a summary, a pointer, a "why" line — run `validate_chat_output(<the text>)` from `chat_output_renderer.py` (`shared/scripts/`). It raises `LeakDetectedError` on a raw id (`person_NNN`, `project_NNN`, `org_NNN`, a `cmt_` / `bp_` / `pcand:` wire id), an event or field name, a file name or path, or a score. ABORT the post and rewrite the sentence with the entity's name (`narration_names.humanize(text, narration_names.name_index(<WORKSPACE>))` is the one substitution). NEVER catch the error and post anyway. Text relayed byte-exact from a driver or the transport is already scanned and is not re-composed.

## Draft date scan (DRAFTDATE1 — MANDATORY on every rendered draft)

**A draft never states a date, day or deadline nothing on file supports.** This skill composes its two intro drafts and the double-opt-in companion note IN-SKILL rather than handing them to email-writer, so the scan every other drafting surface runs has to run here too (REVIEW_LEAK2 F-9). An intro that says "he'll have the deck to you by Friday" or "you two are meeting Tuesday" invents a commitment for a third party, which is worse than inventing one for the CEO.

Before you surface EITHER draft or the companion note, run each body through the scan:

```python
from draft_date_scan import assert_draft_dates
assert_draft_dates(<the draft body>, <the intro row>, today=<the workspace's own day>)
```

**What the row is here.** An intro has no commitment row, so build one from what IS on file for the two people — this is the whole fence, so do not skip it and do not pass `{}`:

```python
intro_row = {
    "title": <the CEO's own words asking for the intro>,
    "summary": <the recent-interaction lines already loaded for A and B>,
    "calendar_dates": <dates of calendar events either person is on>,
}
```

It raises `DraftDateError` naming every phrase nothing on file supports. `today` is the workspace's day (`tz.py`), never a UTC re-slice.

**NEVER catch the error and send anyway, and never invent a date so the sentence reads better.** The fix is to drop the day — an intro reads better without one, since letting the two of them find a time is the whole point — or to name only a day one of the two records actually carries.
## The activity log is append-only (MANDATORY — CONTRACT Rule 31)

This skill touches `_hq/data`. **The activity log is never rewritten by hand.**
`events.jsonl` and its yearly shards are only ever ADDED to, through the
writers (`event_gate.append_event` / `atomic_write.atomic_append_jsonl`). No
step here, and no turn this skill runs in, may edit, truncate, reorder, delete
lines from, back up and rewrite, or restore that file — and may never instruct
anyone else to.

- A duplicate or malformed line is **quarantined through the cleanup skill's
  existing path**, never deleted (`recover_corruption.py` for malformed lines,
  `seq_health.py --mark` for a duplicate entry number).
- Correcting writes this skill made means **appending a reversal through
  `brain_undo.undo_batch`** with the batch ref the run advertised — a receipt
  and a real `undo`. `undo` after a re-run means exactly that batch, or the
  words "nothing to reverse"; never an improvised drop, an invented supersede,
  or a hand-edited file.
- If you believe the file itself must change, **STOP and say so in plain
  words.** Do not do it, and do not offer to.

## Routing (full trigger corpus)

The complete trigger family and fences for this skill, relocated verbatim from the pre-v4.5.1 description (the routing metadata is budget-capped by the platform; routing correctness is enforced mechanically by tests/triggers.yaml). Everything below remains binding at fire time.

> Draft introductions between two people you know — voice-calibrated to your past intros, tuned to both sides' context, and logged into the relationship graph so future people-crm queries surface 'you connected them on [date]'. Use when the CEO says 'intro [A] to [B]', 'intro [A] and [B]', 'connect [A] and [B]', 'make an intro between [A] and [B]', 'introduce [A] to [B]', 'broker an intro', 'set up an intro', 'introduce [name] and [name]'. Produces two drafts (double-opt-in and direct-forward) so the CEO can pick the right intro shape. Reads both people's full records from people-crm + recent interactions with each + past intro_made events as voice samples. Writes intro_made event linking both people, updates entities.json connections graph, scheduled intro_followup_check 30d out to verify landing. DOES NOT fire on 'email [name] about [topic]' (email-writer — single recipient), 'follow up with the intro' (email-writer or follow-up-ritual), or 'who should I introduce to whom' (out of scope — this skill drafts a SPECIFIC intro you've already decided on; it doesn't propose pairings).
